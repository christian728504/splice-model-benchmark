## Forward Stranded Libraries:

- When extracting reads from the + strand of the genome, we want the reverse reads (flag 0x10)
- When extracting reads from the - strand of the genome, we want the forward reads (no flag 0x10)


## Reverse Stranded Libraries:

- When extracting reads from the + strand of the genome, we want the forward reads (no flag 0x10)
- When extracting reads from the - strand of the genome, we want the reverse reads (flag 0x10)


## Unstranded Libraries:

(for the application in this script)
- When extracting reads from the + strand of the genome, we want the forward reads (no flag 0x10)
- When extracting reads from the - strand of the genome, we want the reverse reads (flag 0x10)
